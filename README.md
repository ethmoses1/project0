The object of Tic Tac Toe is to get three in a row. The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
The first player is known as X and the second is O.
Players alternate placing Xs and Os on the game board until either opponent has three in a row or all nine squares are filled.
X always goes first and the first player to get 3 in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
In the event that no one has three in a row, the stalemate is called a cat game(draw).
When all 9 squares are full, the game is over.
