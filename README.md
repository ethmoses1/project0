#Tic Tac Toe
### What is Tic Tac Toe?
Tic tac toe is a game that is played by two opponents( X and O) who seek to complete a row, a column, or a diagonal with either three X's or three O's drawn in a three by three squares.

### Game objective and rules
The object of Tic Tac Toe is to get three in a row.
The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
The first player is known as X and the second is O.
Players alternate placing Xs and Os on the game board until either opponent has three in a row or all nine squares are filled.

#### How is the winner determined?
X always goes first and the first player to get 3 in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
In the event that no one has three in a row, the stalemate is called a cat game(draw).
When all 9 squares are full, the game is over.
